# Final Project: Budify

Dynamic Web Application class with Professor James Ayres

Bato Batbileg

## Concept
Budify is a website that explores the social aspect of music listening experience.

1) Timeline of Music taste: Budify allows users to create a timeline of their musical journey over the years. Each post on Budify includes a music link, a screenshot of their listening activity, and an accompanying image capturing the essence of that moment. With each new post, the user gets to create a visual and auditory diary of their life through music.

2) Memories: Music can be a powerful trigger for memories. Budify helps users document their life's moments through the songs that they listen to at the time. As users scroll through their Budify profile, they get to reignite memories from the past.

3) Friendships: Budify allows users to discover the musical tastes of their friends and explore the depth of their friendships through the lens of music. Budify lets the user see what their friends are listening to, creating new avenues for connection and shared experiences.
